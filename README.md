# Superstore-Profit-Analysis
On this project  I decided to use the SuperStore dataset which represents a sample of online sales for USA retailer store. It includes information of orders, multiple categories, and geographical locations. This is an external and open-source dataset that was created by Tableau for educational purposes in order to familiarize its new users to visualizations. The data was not collected and was generated fictitiously to simulate a retail business. Therefore, extrapolating its behavior to generalize or draw conclusions about similar type of businesses  is not recommended. 

The bussiness questions I wanted to explore were: 

* How to segment the data to better understand the behavior of profit?  
* How does the behavior of sales affect profitability?
* Can any variable predict profitability? 

In the files attached, you can find the Jupyter scripts that include: 
1. Data Cleaning 
2. Initial Data Exploration
3. Geographical Analysis
4. Regression Analysis to predict profit
5. Clustering Analysis using the k-means algorithm
6. Time Series and Forecasting of sales

Additionally, you can find in the following link a summarized version the project:

**Limitations and Ethics Considerations**
As mentioned above the data is based on fake realistic looking data, so it has not been collected from real transactions made by customers. Therefore, there are no ethical or unlawful matters compromising the security and privacy of users. Possible limitations are the restrictions of measuring the accuracy of the data against real data collected by internal sources, meaning, we cannot estimate how close this data mimic the real world of online shopping.
